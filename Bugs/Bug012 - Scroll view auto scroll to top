**Bug012 - Scroll view auto scroll to top**

_Issue:_
- Scroll view auto scroll to top after getting back from a pop, in a pageview for example

_Solution:_
- Move all codes that cause scrollview content size change to view did load
- Have a local var to store contentoffset before the pop operation, set scrollview's contentoffset to that value in viewwillappear

_Reasons:_
- Content size changes cause scroll view's bounds change, which triggers scrollviewdidscroll and scroll view will automatically scroll back to top
